             The first Negro to attend the <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName><lb/>

             acceptance was due to a detour his<lb/>

             <orgName>Circuit Court of Appeals</orgName>.
            </p>
            <p>
             In <date when="1935">1935</date>, <persName ref="#DGM">Murray</persName> was initially refused<lb/>

             for denying <seg corresp="#DGM">him</seg> admission “<choice><orig>be-

             In court, the <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName> conceded that<lb/>
             <persName ref="#DGM">Murray</persName> was denied admission because of<lb/>

             The Court further held that the<lb/>
